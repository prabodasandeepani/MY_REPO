    <h1> TUTORIAL APP</h1>
    <p>
        Another best full stack project ideas is Tutorial App. COVID has given birth to online classes, recorded sessions, and other online resources, hence building such apps would be of great help to students and even working professionals. This tutorial app can have pre-recorded sessions (maybe free or paid), be they video-based or content-based. It may have content for topics based on school-level, college-level, or specialized domains.
